## Implementation Details

### File Processing Workflow

#### Upload Handling:
```
User Upload → Size Check → Processing Decision → Queue Assignment
```

#### For Files Under 650MB:
```
Direct Upload → VirusTotal API → Results Processing → User Display
```

#### For Files Over 650MB:
```
Chunking → Parallel Processing → AI Analysis → Partial VirusTotal Submission → Result Compilation → User Display
```

### AI Model Training Process
1. Collect and label training data from existing virus databases
2. Preprocess binary and text files for feature extraction
3. Train initial models on standard malware patterns
4. Validate models against known threats
5. Implement continuous learning from new scan results
6. Regular model retraining and optimization

### VirusTotal API Integration
```javascript
// Pseudocode for API integration
async function scanFile(fileBuffer, fileName) {
  // For files under the limit
  const response = await vtClient.scanFile({
    file: fileBuffer,
    filename: fileName
  });
  
  return await pollForResults(response.data.id);
}

// For larger files
async function scanLargeFile(filePath) {
  const chunks = await fileChunker.process(filePath);
  const criticalChunks = aiAnalyzer.identifyCriticalChunks(chunks);
  
  const scanPromises = criticalChunks.map(chunk => 
    vtClient.scanFile({
      file: chunk.buffer,
      filename: `${chunk.id}_${chunk.originalName}`
    })
  );
  
  const results = await Promise.all(scanPromises);
  return aiAnalyzer.compileResults(results, filePath);
}
```

### Database Schema

#### Users Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String,
  name: String,
  created_at: Date,
  last_login: Date,
  scan_count: Number,
  subscription_tier: String
}
```

#### Scans Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  file_name: String,
  file_size: Number,
  file_type: String,
  scan_date: Date,
  processing_time: Number,
  chunks_count: Number,
  vt_results: Object,
  ai_results: Object,
  overall_verdict: String,
  threat_level: Number,
  share_link: String,
  is_complete: Boolean
}
```

#### FileChunks Collection (for large files):
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  scan_id: ObjectId,
  chunk_number: Number,
  chunk_size: Number,
  vt_scan_id: String,
  is_processed: Boolean,
  results: Object
}
```

### Monitoring and Analytics
