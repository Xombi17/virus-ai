# AI-Based Virus Checker

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI-powered virus checking system that leverages the VirusTotal API while overcoming its file size limitations. The system will allow users to upload files up to 1GB (or potentially larger) for virus scanning, significantly exceeding VirusTotal's 650MB limit.

## Key Features
- **Large File Support**: Upload and scan files up to 1GB or more
- **AI-Enhanced Detection**: Utilize machine learning to improve detection rates
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Leverage the comprehensive VirusTotal database
- **Size Limit Bypass**: Intelligent file handling for files exceeding VirusTotal limits
- **Shareable Results**: Generate links to scan results for easy sharing
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple upload and scan process
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis of potential threats

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- Web interface for file uploads and result display
- Progress indicators for scanning process
- Dashboard for scan history and results

### Backend
- File processing and handling system
- API integration with VirusTotal
- AI analysis module
- Database for storing scan results

### AI Component
- Machine learning models for enhanced threat detection
- Pattern recognition to identify new or unknown threats
- Behavioral analysis of executable files

## Technical Approach

### Handling Large Files
For files exceeding VirusTotal's 650MB limit, we'll implement:
- **File Chunking**: Breaking large files into analyzable segments
- **Smart Sampling**: Intelligent sampling of file segments for analysis
- **Partial Uploads**: Sending only critical portions to VirusTotal
- **Local Analysis**: Performing primary analysis locally before API submission

### AI Implementation
The AI component will:
- Analyze file behavior patterns
- Identify potential threats based on structural analysis
- Learn from previous scans to improve detection accuracy
- Provide risk assessment for files that can't be fully analyzed by VirusTotal

### API Integration
Integration with VirusTotal will include:
- File submission to the VirusTotal API
- Results retrieval and parsing
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Error handling and retry mechanism

## User Flow
1. User uploads a file through the web interface
2. System determines file size and type
3. For files under 650MB, direct submission to VirusTotal
4. For larger files, implementation of chunking/sampling strategy
5. AI analysis runs in parallel with VirusTotal submission
6. Results are compiled and displayed to user
7. User receives a shareable link to the scan results

## Security Considerations
- Secure file handling and storage
- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Safe handling of potentially malicious files
- Privacy protection for user uploads

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- Initial limitations on file types that can be effectively analyzed
- Potential for false positives/negatives with very large files
- Future improvements to AI models based on collected data
- Expansion of supported file formats and analysis techniques

## Compliance and Legal
- Terms of service alignment with VirusTotal API usage policy
- Clear user agreement regarding file submission and analysis
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Integration Possibilities
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Email attachment scanning
- System monitoring and continuous protection
- API for third-party integrations
